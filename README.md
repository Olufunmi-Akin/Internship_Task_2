### Task : Create a look – Kazi Calls

### Objective 
This task involves exploring the Kazi Calls Dashboard in Looker to generate insights on agent call activity and success rates. Kazi calls refer to outreach made by agents to customers for collections. Required to build two Looks focused on Zambia’s agent performance in November and December 2022.

### Data Sources
The data is sourced from the Kazi Calls Dashboard in Looker, which tracks: Agent call logs (call counts, timestamps), Call outcomes  (e.g., successful or unsuccessful), Customer interaction timelines, Geography filters, specifically by country (Zambia)

### Tools Used
- Looker

### Scope
This task is focused on analyzing Kazi call data specific to Zambia in the months of November and December 2022. You are expected to:
- Explore the Kazi Calls Dashboard to understand the data schema and structure.
- Create two separate Looks to:
   1. Visualize daily call activity per agent in December 2022.
   2. Evaluate and rank agent call success rates in November 2022.
- Filter results to only include agents in Zambia.
- Use dimension groups where needed to break down data by day of the week.
- Ensure accuracy of date filtering and metric calculations.

### Expected Impact:
- Completing this task will provide the business with:
- Clarity on daily agent activity: Understand how active agents are during the week and identify high- or low-engagement days.
- Insights into agent effectiveness: Success rate rankings will help identify top and bottom performers for targeted coaching or reward programs.
- Regional performance transparency: Focused analysis on Zambia allows for targeted operational decisions.
- Increased data accessibility: The created Looks can be reused in future reporting or dashboards.

### Deliverables:
1. Agent Calls by Day of the Week (Zambia, Dec 2022)



2. Kazi Calls Success Rate by Agent (Zambia, Nov 2022)


### Conclusion:
This wide gap between top and bottom performers highlights the need for performance support strategies, such as peer mentoring from high performers, deeper diagnostics on underperformance, and potential review of call data completeness. Identifying what top agents did right could help lift overall team success rates.
